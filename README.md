# Pacman game
Here is just a fun simple game inspired by Pac-Man :)
## Short set of rules
1. Control pacman with four arrow keys.
2. Try to eat as many blue dots as you can.
3. Avoid ghosts.
4. Sometimes you will come across bonuses in the form of fireballs and hearts.
The heart makes ghosts run away from you for a short period of time.
The fireball makes ghosts move chaotic and allows you to eat them for the duration of its effect.
5. Keep a close eye on the current mode in the upper left corner of the screen.
6. With each new level the maze becomes more difficult.
7. Have fun!
